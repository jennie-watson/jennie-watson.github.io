            <h1><strong><u>Sprint 2: Learning Plan</u></strong></h1>
            <br>
            <p>My long term goal is to become a full stack web developer and find a role
            after graduating from Enspiral Dev Academy in the web development field.
            Once I hone and develop my skills further my long term goal is to become
            a web developer consultant.</p>
            <br>     
            <p>While I’m at EDA I would like to develop my leadership skills further and
            feel more confident with public speaking. I think the group projects and
            presentations during bootcamp will be great opportunities for me to develop
            these areas.</p>
            <br>      
            <p>Some of my strengths I bring to EDA is my analytical skills and being able
            to relate to a wide range of people which I have developed through my
            Psychology and Sociology degree and work experience. Some limitations I have
            identified is not being the first to speak up if I am having trouble
            understanding something in particular and making sure I am utilising my time
            effectively. I think that by working on my public speaking skills this will
            help my confidence to speak up more, and by planning my day and week beforehand
            and continue using Toggl each day I can improve my time management skills.</p>
            <br>      
            <p>To help manage my workload I am also going to continue coming into the Auckland
            campus during Foundations and treating this time at campus like a full
            time job. If I need to seek help in the first instance I will use Google
            and look on forums to try and problem solve. If I cannot find the answer
            and am still stuck after a reasonable amount of time (30-45 min) then I’ll
            either ask my fellow students in person or on Slack. If I still cannot find
            a solution I will then ask my facilitator (Allie) for help or other facilitators
            if Allie is not available.</p>
            <br>      
            <p>In terms of my expectations from the facilitators, I appreciate knowing that there
            is drop in sessions available and that help is available on Slack from the
            facilitators team outside of these hours. Regarding my schedule the only commitments
            I have which may need to be managed differently during Bootcamp is soccer practice
            on Tuesday & Wednesday nights and a soccer game on Sunday. Otherwise, I am free
            during the week all the other times to fully commit to my learning at Dev Academy.</p>
