My long term goal is to become a full stack web developer and find a role 
after graduating from Enspiral Dev Academy in the web development field. 
Once I hone and develop my skills further my long term goal is to become 
a web developer consultant. 

While I’m at EDA I would like to develop my leadership skills further and 
feel more confident with public speaking. I think the group projects and 
presentations during bootcamp will be great opportunities for me to develop 
these areas. 

Some of my strengths I bring to EDA is my analytical skills and being able 
to relate to a wide range of people which I have developed through my 
Psychology and Sociology degree and work experience. Some limitations I have 
identified is not being the first to speak up if I am having trouble 
understanding something in particular and making sure I am utilising my time 
effectively. I think that by working on my public speaking skills this will 
help my confidence to speak up more, and by planning my day and week beforehand 
and continue using Toggl each day I can improve my time management skills. 

To help manage my workload I am also going to continue coming into the Auckland 
campus during Foundations and treating this time at campus like a full 
time job. If I need to seek help in the first instance I will use Google 
and look on forums to try and problem solve. If I cannot find the answer 
and am still stuck after a reasonable amount of time (30-45 min) then I’ll 
either ask my fellow students in person or on Slack. If I still cannot find 
a solution I will then ask my facilitator (Allie) for help or other facilitators 
if Allie is not available. 

In terms of my expectations from the facilitators, I appreciate knowing that there 
is drop in sessions available and that help is available on Slack from the 
facilitators team outside of these hours. Regarding my schedule the only commitments 
I have which may need to be managed differently during Bootcamp is soccer practice 
on Tuesday & Wednesday nights and a soccer game on Sunday. Otherwise, I am free 
during the week all the other times to fully commit to my learning at Dev Academy.
