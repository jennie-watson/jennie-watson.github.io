        <h2><strong><u>Problem Solving</u></strong></h2>
        <p>During Week 4 of my Foundations course I learnt about JavaScript in more depth. JavaScript is a scripting language that is used by web developers to add dynamic, interactive content to a web page. Since I am relatively new to programming and had not learnt JavaScript before I found it quite challenging. As part of the course material I was asked to take a list of students and their respective test scores and transform this data into a gradebook, which would be a JavaScript object.</p> 
            
        <p>I started this task by writing steps in pseudocode of what I thought needed to be done, and breaking down the problem into everyday language to make sense of what was being asked. I did become stuck on what I thought would be a straightforward problem. The instructions said to “Create an addScore function that accepts gradebook, name and score arguments. Have addScore push the score to the value of the testScore property that matches the value of the name argument in the given gradebook.” In other words, create an addScore function that will find the test scores of each student and add the new score to the test scores. I tried to simplify the problem and started by writing a simple function for addScore. I then tried different codes which I thought would work but unfortunately encountered a few error messages. I then tried googling what do the error messages mean. I read forums and tried writing other code and practiced this code in the console.log.</p>
            
        <p>After spending half a day on the problem and getting 85% through but coming to a block, I then asked my facilitator for help. I started feeling frustrated and had tried various problem solving techniques and thought I was clearly missing something simple in the code. Allie (EDA facilitator) helped break down the problem and talk me through the process. She encouraged drawing it out and explained what my function was currently doing the way it was written, and suggested some other ways I could think about writing the code. I was very thankful for the suggestions and her clear explanation and I ended up rewriting the code in a simplified way to pass the tests. I also wrote comments after the code so I can make sure I understood what the code function was addressing.</p>
            
        <p>Reflecting on this experience and the way I problem solved I learned that it's okay to ask for help and not let my pride get in the way of this. I tried problem solving techniques of writing Pseudocode, writing different code and testing this, reading error messages and googling these, reading coding forums and console.logging the code I was writing. Once I realised I was getting frustrated and not resolving the problem after spending a significant amount of time on it I asked for help. Allie gave me some really helpful tips to help me problem solve such as drawing out the problem and writing basic code to start, reading example code and making sure I understand it and also reading the error messages carefully so I understand what the computer is saying and learn what these error messages mean next time I encounter them. I learned more problem solving techniques and to persevere, and that its okay to ask for help as I learned a lot and that its okay to admit I don’t know the answers sometimes.</p>
