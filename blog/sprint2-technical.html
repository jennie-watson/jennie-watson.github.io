        What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?

        Web browsers treat every HTML element as a kind of box and 
        this creates the structure of a web page. HTML elements can 
        be split into two major categories which are block and 
        inline elements. Some examples of block elements are the 
        <div>, <p> and <h1> tags. Block elements always stretch out 
        horizontally as far to the sides as possible on a web page 
        and always start on a new line. In other words, it ‘blocks’ 
        all the space it gets in its line. You can add margins and 
        padding on all four sides of any block element — top, right, 
        left, and bottom. 
        
        Inline elements (for example <span>, <img> and <a>) don’t 
        have to start on a new line and only takes up the space that 
        is necessary, so you can have multiple inline elements in the 
        same line. You can add space to the left and right on an 
        inline element, but you cannot add height to the top or bottom 
        padding or margin of an inline element. However, sometimes you 
        need the block and inline CSS display properties combined. 
        That's where CSS display: inline-block value is beneficial. 
        Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, except 
        they can have padding and margins added on all four sides. 
        You have to specifically declare display: inline-block in 
        your CSS code, and one common use for using inline-block is 
        for creating navigation links horizontally.
            
            
        A summary of inline, block and inline-block elements is below:

        Inline elements:
        1. Respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
        2. Cannot have a width and height set
        3. Allow other elements to sit to their left and right.
        
        Block elements:
        1. Respect top, right, left and bottom margins and padding.
        2. Force a line break after the block element.
        3. Acquires full-width if width not defined.

        Inline-block elements:
        1. Allow other elements to sit to their left and right.
        2. Respect top & bottom margins and padding.
        3. Respect height and width.
