            <p>Web browsers treat every HTML element as a kind of box and this creates the structure of a web page. HTML elements can be split into two major categories which are block and inline elements. Some examples of block elements are the div, p and h1 tags. Block elements always stretch out horizontally as far to the sides as possible on a web page and always start on a new line. In other words, it ‘blocks’ all the space it gets in its line. You can add margins and padding on all four sides of any block element — top, right, left, and bottom.</p>
           
            <p>Inline elements (for example span, img and a) don’t have to start on a new line and only takes up the space that is necessary, so you can have multiple inline elements in the same line. You can add space to the left and right on an inline element, but you cannot add height to the top or bottom padding or margin of an inline element.</p>
            
            <p>However, sometimes you need the block and inline CSS display properties combined. That's where CSS display: inline-block value is beneficial. Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, except they can have padding and margins added on all four sides. You have to specifically declare display: inline-block in your CSS code, and one common use for using inline-block is for creating navigation links horizontally.</p>
