        <h2><strong><u>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</u></strong></h2>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain’s capacity to change over the course of a lifetime. Unlike the conventional thinking that our brains were hardwired at birth and unchangeable, research has found that brains can indeed change after a person had reached adulthood. Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to form new connections and pathways through new experiences and learning, and when people stop practicing new things the brain will eventually “prune” the connecting pathways.</p> 
            
        <p>Studies have shown that some techniques for increasing neuroplasticity are traveling, as this exposes the brain to new environments and experiences, learning a new musical instrument, language or challenging subject, exercising, mindfulness and getting sufficient sleep as this helps with learning retention.</p>
            
        <p>Neuroplasticity and a growth mindset are connected as a person with a growth mindset believes that they can get smarter, or more skilled at something through sustained effort, and neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt and develop beyond childhood development.</p>
            
        <p>Growth mindset is very important for personal growth and development and there are studies by Carol Dweck which exemplify this. The studies found that students who have a growth mindset and believed their abilities and intelligence are malleable and can change performed better than students who had a fixed mindset. A fixed mindset views ability as static and avoids challenges, where as a growth mindset views ability as being developed, embraces challenges and learns from criticism.</p>

        <h3><strong><u>How will I apply a Growth Mindset?</u></strong></h3>

        <p>When reflecting on my own personal experiences and beliefs I think I have had a fixed mindset throughout my childhood and teenage years. It was only after my experiences of learning at University while studying Psychology and Sociology, completing Outward Bound, an outdoor education course which challenges you both physically and mentally, and meeting and developing my relationship with my wife Sinead that I started to shift to having a growth mindset. I also spent time living and travelling in Europe with Sinead and this life experience greatly enriched my world views as I learned about different cultures and the various ways of living.</p>

        <p>I have found myself reverting back to a fixed mindset when encountering challenging situations and feeling frustrated. However, I know the importance of having a growth mindset, especially while studying web development. Some techniques I am going to apply to make sure I succeed is challenging the negative self talk I experience at times directly, talking to people and listening to their unique views and taking their advice on board and making sure I develop really good habits as this will be invaluable in my learning journey.</p>
