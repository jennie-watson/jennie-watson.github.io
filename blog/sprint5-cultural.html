        <h2><strong><u>Reflection - Foundations Core Skills</u></strong></h2>
        <p>What surprised me the most about learning core is all the different subjects that were introduced as part of the core material and how relevant and complimentary these topics are to becoming a successful coder. Prior to EDA I didn't know too much about emotional intelligence and the neuroplasticity and growth mindset. I enjoyed learning about all of the core topics so far and can definitely see the relevance in how developing these skills can not only make me a better programmer, but a more well rounded person. Until now I also hadn't practiced mindfulness and hadn't really spent time reflecting properly on my core values as a person. Doing this made me feel vulnerable and also made me really think about what is important to me and what I truly value. I was also surprised by the listening and looping exercises and that this felt quite awkward at first as my natural instinct would be to talk to the other person and not just listen and fully pay attention, not only to what was being said but the body language and non verbal communication cues too.</p> 
            
        <h3><i>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</i></h3>
        <p>Until coming to EDA I had never properly spent time reflecting on what my core values are. I found this exercise to be very interesting and it also made me feel vulnerable as I really took time to reflect on what is important to me and where these values may have originated from. I have also learned about emotional intelligence, neuroplasticity and the growth mindset and this was a really enriching experience. Until properly researching these topics I didn’t know that emotional intelligence highly correlates with life success and that EQ can be learned and improved through techniques such as reflection and self-evaluation, mindfulness and practicing active listening. I sometimes consider myself too proud to ask for help and the core learning material has helped me realise that this is not a sign of weakness and I can learn a lot and improve as a person by listening and letting others in. I also learned the importance of reflection, as rather than just living my life day to day and not taking the time to reflect, I’ve been minimising opportunities to grow and learn from experiences.</p>
            
        <h3><i>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</i></h3>
        <p>The relevance of the core learning and how this helps produce better programmers and not just more well rounded people. I think the core material is very important and through practicing reflection this has helped me retain what I’ve learned more in each sprint.</p>
            
        <h3><i>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</i></h3>
        <p>I found the mindfulness and being present in the moment to be challenging and found my mind wandering at times. I also found it challenging to consider what my top core values were as I had written a list of about 10 values and then had to really consider what were the most important of values for me.</p>

        <h3><i>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</i></h3>
        <p>I think the amount of core learning is appropriate and relevant to the curriculum as I think that the core learning currently makes up about 20% of the coursework. As workplaces are focussing more on team culture and not necessarily looking for the person with the best technical skills, I think that integrating core learning into the course material to be very relevant and important. I am looking forward to practicing human skills such as mindfulness and yoga, teamwork and communication skills as part of the bootcamp routine and think these are very important skills to continue practicing.</p>

        <h3><i>WDoes the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</i></h3>
        <p>I think the core learning has been helpful and not a waste of time. I studied Psychology and Sociology and some of the core material was a good refresher for me. I also learned a lot of new material from the topics such as EQ vs IQ and researching the growth mindset and neuroplasticity. I don’t think any more time should be spent on the human skills side and an 80/20 balance of technical/core is a good amount of time to spend on the core learning as part of the curriculum.</p>
