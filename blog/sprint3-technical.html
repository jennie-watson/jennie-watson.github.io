        <h2><strong><u>HTML & CSS</u></strong></h2>
            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the structure of any web page. If you think of a house being built, HTML would be the structure of the house. A house has rooms, and similarly, a web page has sections (e.g. header, body, footer), and each section contains images and text. HTML organizes and presents the elements of a webpage in a structured hierarchy. An example of HTML as a house is below:</p>
            <ul class="house">
                <li><house></li>
                <li><first-floor</li>
                <li><bedroom></li>
                <li><bed></li>
                <li></bedroom></li>
                <li></first-floor></li>
                <li></house></li>
            </ul>

            <p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets defines how elements look, so in the house analogy CSS would control the styling such as what colour the walls are, the size of the bedrooms, the furniture and furnishings inside the home etc. Without CSS the house would just be a structure. CSS styles web pages and plays an important role in how a website looks and feels. An example of CSS as a house would be:
            bedroom {
            width: 12ft;
            height: 8ft;
            walls: 1mm wallpaper matte;
            floor: carpet
            }
            </p>

        <h2><strong><u>Control Flow & Loops</u></strong></h2>
            <p>The control flow is the order in which a computer reads and executes statements in a script. The control flow usually reads code from top to bottom, although conditions such as loops in Javascript can change this order. An example of control flow in soccer is before a soccer game I will:</p>

            <ol class="soccer">
                <li><Get changed into gear></li>
                <li><Do warm up exercises</li>
                <li><Drink water></li>
                <li><Stretch></li>
                <li></Discuss game tactics></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Loops in Javascript are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times or while a specified condition is true. There are two different kinds of loops in JavaScript which are ‘for’ loops and ‘while’ loops. ‘For’ loops through a block of code a specified number of times and ‘while’ loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true. Loops are great to use in JavaScript as they can streamline the execution of repetitive tasks and makes code easier to read.</p> 


        <h2><strong><u>The DOM</u></strong></h2>
            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. The DOM represents the document as nodes and object, and that way programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript can connect to the page and change the document structure, style and content. The DOM is accessed by right clicking and clicking ‘inspect’ and is built into most browsers and is a powerful tool for web developers to use.</p> 


        <h2><strong><u>Arrays & Objects</u></strong></h2>
            <p>Arrays and Objects are both ways of storing data in JavaScript. Arrays are like lists in JavaScript and they help store, organise and retrieve data. An example of the way an array is written is groceryList[milk, bread, cheese, icecream] . unlike humans, computers count starting from 0, so if I wanted to access an item on the array I would type groceryList[0] and this would output “milk.”</p>

            <p>Objects are a collection of named values and are used to group related data and functions together. An example of an object is:
            var myComputer = {
            operatingSystem: 'mac',
            screensize: '15 inches',
            purchaseYear: 2011
            };

            To access an item from the object type the variable (myComputer) is written followed by a . and the object (e.g. screensize)
            myComputer.operatingSystem
            = "mac"
            myComputer.screensize
            = "15 inches"
            myComputer.purchaseYear
            = 2011
            </p>

            <h2><strong><u>Functions</u></strong></h2>
            <p>Functions are a block of code that executes a certain task and can contain loops and conditions. Functions are similar to a set of instructions and comprise of a set of code you want to run, and returns a result when the function is called. Functions are essential in JavaScript as they can streamline a repetitive task so you won’t need to write the same code time and time again, and also help make code more readable. An example of a funtion is:
            function makeToastedSandwich()  {
            Get one slice of bread;
            Add sandwich fillings;
            Put a slice of bread on top;
            }

            Writing makeToastedSandwich(); will run 
            Get one slice of bread;
            Add sandwich fillings;
            Put a slice of bread on top;
            </p>
