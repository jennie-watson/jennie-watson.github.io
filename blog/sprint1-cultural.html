            Some of my core personal values are Openness, Integrity and Teamwork. For the first value, Openness, 
            I believe that being open to new experiences, ideas and people’s viewpoints is very important to grow 
            as a person and have a more informed world-view. In the multicultural society we all live in I think 
            it's very important to have an open mindset and not judge people since everyone has unique life 
            experiences which help shape them. 
            
            Integrity is also very important to me as I believe in striving to do the right thing and doing this 
            well, and also being reliable and trustworthy. In my previous job as an ACC Case Manager it was very 
            important that my clients could rely on me to follow through on what I said I would do and also that 
            I displayed integrity in my work everyday and had the confidence and trust of the public. 
            
            Teamwork is a core value which I hold in high regard too. Similarly to Openness I think that everyone 
            brings different experiences and knowledge to situations. When I reflect on some of my happiest 
            experiences such as travelling with my spouse, playing soccer and completing Outward Bound, a common 
            theme is being with people and in a team environment. I believe that teamwork is listening to team 
            members with an open mind, sharing knowledge, making decisions based on reason, treating others with 
            respect and having a shared common goal. When defining what teamwork is these also link in with my 
            core values of openness and integrity.
