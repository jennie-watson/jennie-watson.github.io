            <h2><strong><u>Sprint 1: Identity, Values & Strengths</u></strong></h2>
           <p>Some of my core personal values are Openness, Integrity and Teamwork. For the first value, Openness, I believe that being open to new experiences, ideas and people’s viewpoints is very important to grow as a person and have a more informed world-view. In the multicultural society we all live in I think it's very important to have an open mindset and not judge people since everyone has unique life experiences which help shape them.</p>
           
           <p>Integrity is also very important to me as I believe in striving to do the right thing and doing this well, and also being reliable and trustworthy. In my previous job as an ACC Case Manager it was very important that my clients could rely on me to follow through on what I said I would do and also that I displayed integrity in my work everyday and had the confidence and trust of the public.</p>
           
           <p>Teamwork is a core value which I hold in high regard too. Similarly to Openness I think that everyone brings different experiences and knowledge to situations. When I reflect on some of my happiest experiences such as travelling with my spouse, playing soccer and completing Outward Bound, a common theme is being with people and in a team environment. I believe that teamwork is listening to team members with an open mind, sharing knowledge, making decisions based on reason, treating others with respect and having a shared common goal. When defining what teamwork is these also link in with my core values of openness and integrity.</p>
