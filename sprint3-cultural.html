        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is a term that first evolved in 1995 by psychologist, Daniel Goleman, and it is a measure of a person’s level of emotional intelligence. EQ is centered on abilities such as identifying emotions, evaluating and perceiving how others feel, controlling one’s own emotions, using emotions to facilitate social communication and relating to others. Five main areas have been found that define one’s emotional intelligence are self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, social skills and motivation. 
                In practical terms, EQ means being aware that emotions can drive our behavior and impact people (both positively and negatively), and learning how to manage those emotions, especially when we are under pressure. Some other examples of when someone would need to manage their EQ is when giving and receiving feedback, meeting tight deadlines, dealing with challenging relationships and change and dealing with setbacks and failure.</p>                

        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>The major differences between IQ and EQ are: 
                An individual’s level of emotional intelligence is called Emotional Quotient or EQ. Intelligence Quotient or IQ is a number obtained from standardised intelligence test and this measures general intelligence and a person’s ability of logical reasoning.
                A person’s success in school depends on their IQ level, whereas a person’s EQ level reflects their success in real life.
                EQ measures an individual’s social and emotional competencies or one’s ability to recognise one’s own and other person’s emotional expression. Conversely, IQ measures a person’s academic competency and reasoning ability.
                Emotional Quotient is a learned and improved ability, as opposed to IQ which is an inborn ability. 
                A person with good EQ can recognise, control and express one’s own emotions, perceive and assess other’s emotions. On the contrary, a person with a high IQ can learn, understand and implement knowledge, and possesses logical reasoning and abstract thinking.
                High emotional intelligence can be seen in leaders, captains, managers and people with social challenges. Unlike, IQ identifies people with high intellect, common sense, mental challenges, etc.
                The difference between IQ and EQ is that no one can alter their intelligence or reasoning abilities, but anyone can learn to handle emotions, to bring success for them.
                Also, having a high IQ might be a good predictor of a career path or industry, but your EQ score will determine how well you will function in that position (e.g. teamwork, leadership, etc.). The prevailing theory is that EQ and IQ do not work in opposition to one another, but are instead complementary aspects of an individual that often overlap and work together.

        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>EQ is important as studies have shown that having high EQ correlates to success in life. In a work environment studies have found that emotional intelligence to be more important than IQ, and that the higher up the ladder you go, the more important it becomes - meaning that the differentiating factor among people who are at a reasonably high level at a company, is not IQ, but EQ. Those with higher EQ typically successfully navigate the workplace more effectively. EQ enables an individual to build and drive successful teams, and to be agile and responsive as needed. 
                EQ is, in many ways, the essence of being human. Emotional Intelligence, and our ability to draw on it as a reserve, helps us in so many ways: from assisting in looking after our physical and mental health and well-being, through to our ability to inspire and lead. It’s there in our ability to manage effective relationships and very important when it comes to conflict resolution. It is, in so many ways, the driver of success.
